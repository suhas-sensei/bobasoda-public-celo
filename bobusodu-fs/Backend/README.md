## **What is Bobasoda?**
Bobasoda is a one-minute prediction market game built on **[Base](https://base.org)**, where players bet on whether the price of an asset will go up or down in the next 60 seconds.  
It’s quick, fun, and entirely on-chain — a blend of trading instincts and game-like excitement.

## **How It Works**

### **1. Join a Round**
Every 60 seconds, a new round begins. Players predict whether the price will go **Up** or **Down** at the end of the minute.

### **2. Wait for the Clock to Run Out**
Once the round locks, all entries are sealed. The result is fetched from a trusted **price oracle**.

### **3. Claim Your Winnings**
If your prediction is correct, you instantly win a share of the prize pool.  
If not — your stake goes toward rewarding the winners of that round.
